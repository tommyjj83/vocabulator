# Owner
This project is created by Tomáš Jaroš, tomasek.jaros@seznam.cz, and @tommyjj83 on GitHub.

# Application overview
This project is a GUI application designed to extend users' vocabulary. The user can add new words they wish to learn. The application then shows them a word to translate, and they insert its translation. The application provides a possibility to mark a word as learned or modify the time after which it will display the words.

# Notes
This application is my first GIU project in C++. It is done using Qt.

# External Libraries
For text validation, ICU libraries are used. If one wants to build this project, they need to have them installed. Run:
 - sudo apt update && sudo apt install icu-devtools libicu-dev libicu72

If performed successfully, the project can be linked against them.
