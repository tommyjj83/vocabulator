# Application overview
This project is intended to be a GUI application for extending user's vocabulary. User should be able to add new words he wishes to learn. The application then shows him a word and user needs to insert its translation. The applicaiton should provide possibility to mark a word as learned or modify the time after which it will display the words.

# Notes
This application is my first GIU project in C++. It is done using Qt.
